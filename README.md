Hackathon Project: IQ Data Stream Compression for Testing & Measurement
Problem Statement
Modern testing and measurement devices, such as oscilloscopes and signal generators, handle massive volumes of IQ (In-phase and Quadrature) data streams. These high-frequency signals require efficient storage and transmission, especially in remote processing applications.

The key challenges include:
•	Handling large-scale IQ data transmission over limited bandwidth channels.
•	Ensuring lossless or near-lossless compression to retain signal fidelity.
•	Optimizing for real-time processing without overburdening the testing device.
•	Enabling reconstruction of the original signal at the receiver end.
